For this application you will be building a music application where users can log in through Spotify and search for music. You should use `passport-spotify` to authenticate users, and make sure to store your credentials in a `.env` file and add a `.env` to your `.gitignore`!

### Bonus

Add the ability for logged in users to search Spotify and create playlists on their Spotify accounts. You can use the [spotify node wrapper](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node) for this and use the access token sent back to you from Spotify to make authenticated calls.
