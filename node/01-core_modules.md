# Core Modules

For this exercise, we are going to build a simple command line tool which allows us to make a request to an API and store the data in a text file! We will be using the following modules:

`fs` - for reading and writing to a file
`process` - for gathering arguments from the command line
`request` - for making API requests (this is an external module)

This application should accept a command line argument using `process.argv`. The command line argument should be a search term and your application should make an API request to the [dad joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to search for a joke based on the search term. If it finds jokes matching the term, it should output a random joke, and should also save the joke to a file called `jokes.txt`. If it doesn't find a joke, it should log a message to the console telling the user that no jokes were found for that search term.

### Bonus

1. Use the [prompt](https://github.com/flatiron/prompt) module to ask a user for some input instead of having to pass in an argument from the command line.
2. Your program should accept a command line argument called `leaderboard`. If that command line argument is passed in, your application should return the most popular joke based on how many times it appears in `jokes.txt`
