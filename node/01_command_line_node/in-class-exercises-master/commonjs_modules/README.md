# CommonJS Modules Exercise

Take a look at this directory structure. There is 1 JS file in the directory called `one`, and then 2 JS files in a sub-directory of one called `two`, then three JS files in a sub-directory of two called `three`.

Write a script called `getTheMessage.js` that imports all of the files in order, starting with `one1.js` down to `three3.js`. Then concatenate the imported modules (they are all strings) in order to reveal and `console.log` the full message.

Try to use `index.js` files in each directory where applicable.
