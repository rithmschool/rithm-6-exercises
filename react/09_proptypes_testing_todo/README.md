# React Prop Types & Testing

For this assignment, add prop type validation, default props (if necessary), and tests for your ToDo Application.

While you're going through this application, try to be specific about your prop types and see if you can create custom prop types for your todos! Make sure that every component that you render has propTypes on it.

The tests should utilize Jest snapshot tests for components and Enzyme for shallow mounting.
