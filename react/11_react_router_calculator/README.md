# React Router Calculator

It's time to build another routing-based calculator, but this time with React Router!

Build a calculator that supports routes like:

* `/add/1/2` - should render a component that displays 3.
* `/subtract/3/2` - should render a component that displays 1.
* `/multiply/6/4` - should render a component that displays 24.
* `/divide/20/5` - should render a component that displays 4.

As a bonus, try to do this without using a different component for each of the four math operations!
