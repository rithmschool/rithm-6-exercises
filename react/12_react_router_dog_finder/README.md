# React Router Dog Finder

Earlier you saw an example of an app that used the HTML5 history api to build a single page app. ([Here's](https://github.com/rithmschool/history-example) a link.) In this exercise, your goal will be to refactor the app to use React Router!

Try to build the app so that you have a single `Route` component that renders details on the dog - this details component should display a dog's information based on props passed to it.

Here's an image of what the app looks like. It should look the same once you've refactored it!
