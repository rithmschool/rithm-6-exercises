## Component Lifecycle in React

### Part 1

Rebuild the [Giphy API exercise](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-part-2/ajax-exercises) with React.

Once you finished rebuilding this application, include a "gif of the day", which should be a random gif generated, when the page loads. You **will** need to use a component life cycle method for this.

### Part 2

In your Todo App, add the ability to edit a todo. The UI and component architecture is up to you, but a user should be able to update the task of a todo even after it has been created. Depending on the UI which you choose, you may have to use one or more lifecycle hooks to ensure that your application works as expected.

As a bonus, store your todos in `localStorage`! When using `localStorage`, you will need to use a life cycle method in order for this to work properly.
