## Component Lifecycle in React

### Part 1

Rebuild the [Giphy API exercise](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-part-2/ajax-exercises) with React.

Once you finished rebuilding this application, include a "gif of the day", which should be a random gif generated, when the page loads. You **will** need to use a component life cycle method for this.

### Part 2

Add another component to your Todo App called `EditTodoForm`, which renders a form to edit a todo. When the form is submitted, it should rename the todo's task.

Depending on the UI which you choose, you may have to use a few lifecycle hooks to ensure that your application works as expected.

As a bonus, store your todos in `localStorage`! When using `localStorage`, you will need to use a life cycle method in order for this to work properly.
