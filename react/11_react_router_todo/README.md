# React Router Todo App

Now that you have seen how to perform some simple routing - it's time to refactor your Todo application!

The first thing you want to do is add React Router and set up the following RESTful routes.

- `/todos` - list all of your todos
- `/todos/new` - render a form to create a new todos
- `/todos/:id` - list a single todo
- `/todos/:id/edit` - render a form to edit an existing todo

As a bonus, when a user creates, updates or deletes a todo - they should be redirected to the `/todos` page. You can start reading a bit about redirects in the next section or check out the React Router docs for some hints on how to `<Redirect/>` (we just gave you one right there!)
