### Part 2

Create two components, `TodoList` and `Todo`. The `TodoList` component should contain an array called todos. The TodoList component should be responsible for listing all of the Todo components, which should each display the task necessary to complete.

You have full control of what you would like the UI of this application to be, but think carefully about the components you will need as well as the props and state. To get started faster, use create-react-app so that you don't have to worry about configuring webpack and babel.

NOTE: for this part, please create a **separate branch**, as this exercise will build on itself over several days. By the end you'll have a basic Todo app working in React. This assignment will eventually be submitted as the solution to `08_react_todo_list`.
