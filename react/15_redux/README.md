# Redux Exercise

In this exercise, you will build a mood changer app that uses redux to alter the mood of a text emoji, as shown below:

You should use the starter `index.html` boilerplate.

You can use whatever ASCII faces you want, [you can find them here](https://www.jemoticons.com/en/).

Remember that since you are using Redux, your reducer must be a pure function. Your actions should include a payload with the new face.

You can use raw JavaScript or JQuery, with Redux CDN included in the HTML script tag (this has been done for you in the boilerplate).

**Do not bulid this application using React - this should strictly be done with Redux**
