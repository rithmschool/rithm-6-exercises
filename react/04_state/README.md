## React State Exercises

### Part 1

For this exercise, you will create 24 components (square shaped divs) that have a specific background color. Each time you click on one of the divs, it cycles to the next background color.

_BONUS_ - Make the background color changing random, i.e. when I click a color, it selects randomly from the list of colors.

Your application should look like this:

![Random Colors](./clickcolors.gif)

### Part 2

For this exercise, you will create a coin flipping game. The user should be able to click on a button to flip a coin. Every time the user clicks, the coin gets flipped again. The app should also keep track of how many times heads and tails have shown up.

Before building anything, _think about the structure of your React app._ Don't build this application with a single component: think about how to break your app up into at least two separate components!

Here's some inspiration:
