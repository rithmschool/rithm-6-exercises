# WTForms

Refactor your User and Message application to use WTForms. Make sure your forms do the following

* Validate that each user has a `first_name` and `last_name`
* Validate that each message has a `content`
* have `csrf` protection

### Bonus

Add client side validation! Use JavaScript to stop users from submitting from submitting forms if their data is incorrect. Try to even alert users before they submit the form using keypress events!
